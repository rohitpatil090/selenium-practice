We can execute our Selenium Automation Scripts on Chrome Headless Browser
Chrome Headless Browser unlike normal Chrome Browser, won't have any GUI


Advantages:
    •Tests will Run faster.resulting in better performance
    •Multitasking:-While our scripts are getting executed, we can do our other tasks as nothing will interrupt us
    
    
Disadvantages
     •We cannot see how the tests are getting executed
     •We won't get to know if something fails during the execution, as nothing is visible
